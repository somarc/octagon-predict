**Octagon Predict: Phase 1 Smart Contracts Locked – Onward to Testnet & Trading on VeChainThor**

Huge milestone! The smart contract suite is complete, reviewed, and perfectly tailored for our Polymarket-inspired UFC prediction market. ConditionalTokens + MarketFactory + Exchange + AdminOracle form the battle-tested foundation — mirroring Polymarket/Gnosis CTF mechanics exactly while optimized for VeChainThor’s low-cost, enterprise-grade performance. Every on-chain action (splitting positions, settling trades, redeeming winnings) burns **VTHO** extensively as gas, ensuring seamless, eco-friendly trading for UFC fans worldwide.

This stack enables:
- Binary markets: “Gaethje wins UFC 324” vs “Pimblett wins” (Yes/No shares priced $0-$1).
- Multi-outcome props: Method of victory (KO/TKO, Submission, Decision), Round totals, Goes the distance.
- Hybrid trading: Off-chain order book with EIP-712 signed orders → batched on-chain settlement via Exchange.sol.
- Credible resolution: AdminOracle tied directly to official UFC results (ufc.com/events) for undisputed payouts.

We’re now primed to launch real markets for **UFC 324 (Gaethje vs Pimblett, January 24, 2026 @ T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas)** and **UFC 325 (Volkanovski vs Lopes 2)** — the first Paramount+ streamed events.

### Recommended Next Step: **VeChain Testnet Deployment with Hardhat** (Proceed Now)

Why testnet deployment first?
- Validates the full suite end-to-end on VeChain Testnet (real **VTHO** faucet, Connex/Sync2 wallet interaction).
- Allows immediate creation of UFC 324 test markets (winner + method props) for demo/screenshots.
- Exposes any VeChain-specific quirks (multi-clause tx, fee delegation, VIP180 handling) before mainnet.
- Sets up the deployed contract addresses needed for the off-chain order book (EIP-712 domain separator relies on Exchange address).

Once deployed and verified:
- We instantly move to off-chain order book specs (Node.js matching engine + signed order flow).
- Frontend can swap mock bets for real wallet-signed trades.

### Immediate Action Plan: Testnet Deployment Setup

Let’s add to the repo:
1. `/contracts` folder with the four .sol files (already built).
2. Hardhat config tailored for VeChain Testnet:
   ```ts
   // hardhat.config.ts
   networks: {
     vechain_testnet: {
       url: "https://testnet.vechain.org",
       accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
       chainId: 100010,
       gasPrice: 1000000000000, // VeChain specifics
     }
   }
   ```
3. Deployment scripts:
   - Deploy ConditionalTokens (immutable).
   - Deploy MarketFactory + Exchange + AdminOracle (pointing to CTF).
   - Verify on VeChainStats explorer.
4. Faucet **VTHO**/**VET** for testing splits/trades.
5. Create sample UFC 324 market:
   - Condition: “Who wins main event?”
   - Outcomes: [“Justin Gaethje”, “Paddy Pimblett”]
   - Link to official https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-324

This gets us live test markets in days — real share trading fueled by **VTHO**, mirroring Polymarket depth but 100% Octagon-focused.

I’ll proceed with drafting the full Hardhat deployment scripts and verification steps now unless you want to pivot to order book specs first.

Let’s deploy to testnet and start trading Gaethje vs Pimblett probabilities — Dana White’s attention starts with real crowd wisdom on VeChainThor! 🥊🔥🚀
